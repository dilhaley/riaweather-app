# riaweather-app

This is a Simple Weather App that shows the next 6 forecasts every 3 hours, as well as the forecast for the next 5 upcoming days.

These forecasts are based on the timezone of the chosen city and include temperature, precipitation percentage and time, as well as weather descriptions and daily high and low temps. This data is based on the OpenWeather API.

The header contains a city search function that adds a custom city to the tabs above to see the forecast for any city in the world.

The app is built using the latest Vue.js Framework, packaged with Vite, and deployed with Firebase.
